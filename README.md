To execute the entire Node.js application, you need to follow these steps:

Make sure you have Node.js installed on your computer. You can download the latest version from the official Node.js website (https://nodejs.org).

Open a command prompt or terminal window.

Navigate to the root directory of your Node.js application using the cd command. For example, if your application is located in a folder named "news-app", you would run the following command: 
cd news-app
Install the required dependencies specified in the package.json file. Run the following command:
npm install
This will download and install all the dependencies listed in the package.json file.

Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the Node.js application by running the following command:
node server.js
This command will run the server.js file, which contains the server logic for your application.

If everything is set up correctly, you should see a message in the console indicating that the server has started. It might be something like:
Server started on port 3000
This means that your application is now running and listening for incoming requests on port 3000.

Open a web browser and enter the URL http://localhost:3000 (or the appropriate port number if you specified a different one). You should see your news sharing website.

You can now interact with your Node.js application through the web browser. You can add, edit, delete news articles, and perform search operations.

If you make any changes to your code, you'll need to stop the Node.js application by pressing Ctrl + C in the command prompt or terminal, and then repeat steps 5 and 6 to restart the application with the updated code.

That's it! You have successfully executed your Node.js application. Let me know if you have any further questions.
